## Session Title

Making a Mathematical Statistics Course More Modern

## Breakout Description
 
A course in statistical theory that immediately follows a Probability course is typically required of undergraduate statistics majors. With the recent boom in "data science," how should we update what students learn in such a course to keep pace with how the field of statistics is used today and will be used in the coming years. In this session, we will discuss a few possible ways to help students see how even a theory course can be applied to tackle real statistical problems and issues. Our primary goal of the session is to have a thoughtful discussion with participants about what "might" go into an undergraduate statistical theory course to best enhance our students' statistical thinking skills and to best prepare our undergraduates for careers in our discipline. The intended audience for this breakout session are instructors who have recently taught or who, in the near future, plan on teaching an undergraduate course in mathematical statistics. There is no pre-requisite knowledge or technology requirements, but we would be very excited to hear about others' experience with this course and any useful strategies they have with how to keep the course both relevant and modern.


## Connection to Theme

Our primary connection to the theme _Useful Models_ is a focus on the word "useful." In terms of a statistical theory course, how should we be defining "useful?" We believe that the topics of a statistical theory course can be "useful" if they can be applied to a real-world setting, which is perhaps what students most often think of when they hear the word "useful." But, topics and examples can also be "useful" if, for example, they enhance statistical logic and reasoning skills in our students. For example, in a statistical theory course, students might be asked to write a short meaningful story incorporating some common terms in statistics like Estimator, Likelihood, Estimate, Bias, etc. (an activity originally appearing in "Fostering Conceptual Understanding in Mathematical Statistics" by Green and Blankenship (2015). While this activity is likely never going to applied to "real world data," the activity might still be "useful" if students' understandings of statistical concepts are enhanced.

## Engagement

A rough outline of how we might plan this session to maximize engagement is below. We hope to present a couple of our own ideas at the beginning of the session to help get people thinking about activities or projects that they have tried or hope to try in their own statistical theory courses.

1. (~ 5 mins). Introductions.

2. (~ 10 mins). Brief presentation on one topic/activity that we have recently tried to incorporate into our own statistical theory course (e.g., the meaningful story mentioned above, modified from an activity by Green and Blankenship (2015)).

3. (~ 15 mins). Ask participants to complete a shortened version of the activity and then to discuss the benefits of activity, drawbacks of activity, and how others might modify the activity to improve it for their student population.

4. (~ 10 mins). Brief presentation on one topic/activity that we have recently tried to incorporate into our own statistical theory course (e.g., incorporating Bayesian thinking, a topic that Rossman et al. (1998) suggest to include in a statisticl theory course in their article "Bayes Estimators for the Continuous Uniform Distribution").

5. (~ 15 mins). Ask participants to complete a shortened version of the activity and then to discuss the benefits of activity, drawbacks of activity, and how others might modify the activity to improve it for their student population.

6. (~ 15 mins). Small group discussion, with the primary question of interest being "What do we want undergraduates completing a statistical theory course to be able to do by the end of the course?" Secondary questions might include "What do you think students will remember from your statistical theory course in 5 years?" and "The GAISE report (<https://www.amstat.org/docs/default-source/amstat-documents/gaisecollege_full.pdf>) for introductory statistics recommends use of real data. To what extent do you think this recommendation should be used for a statistical theory course?"

7. (~ 5 mins). Wrap up with asking everyone (including ourselves) to think of a few actionable, achieveable items that we want to do before the next time we teach a statistical theory course.

## Take Aways

We hope that every instructor will leave the session with a couple of new ideas for topics or activities that they might incorporate in their next iteration of their statistical theory course. Additionally, while this is not an assessible take-away (sorry, Bloom!), we hope that participants will leave the session thinking about what students should learn from a statistical theory course. In their paper "Curriculum Guidelines for Bachelor of Arts Degrees in Statistical Science," Tarpey et al. (2002) state that "the usual version (of a statistical theory course) is neither representative of modern statistical practice nor a good introduction to statistical thinking, and we encourage alternatives." Participants should leave with some ideas about how to make such a course more representative of modern statistical practice. There has been an enormous amount of awesome research into how to best keep intro statistics, foundational data science, and "stat 2" courses modern. We hope that participants will leave the session with some energy to give the same care and attentiveness to their statistical theory courses as well.
