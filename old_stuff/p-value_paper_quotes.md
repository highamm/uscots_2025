p-value Paper Quotes

A couple other quotes came for up me frequently:

1) “Be modest in recognizing there is not a “true statistical model” underlying every problem, which is why it is wise to thoughtfully consider many possible models”
(this doesn't surprise me - I say this a LOT)

2) Quite a few students chose a quote that talks about embracing uncertainty. There are several that fit that theme. These are the two most common.

“move toward a greater acceptance of uncertainty and embracing of variation” (Gelman 2016)”(Section 3.1, first paragraph on page 3)
“Uncertainty exists everywhere in research. And, just like with the frigid weather in a Wisconsin winter, there are those who will flee from it, trying to hide in warmer havens elsewhere. Others, however, accept and even delight in the omnipresent cold; these are the ones who buy the right gear and bravely take full advantage of all the wonders of a challenging climate”

Two quotes were chosen by multiple independent students, both of which might be interesting to bring up but neither of which leads to an activity (at least not an activity that I can think of).

The first quote parallels the use of p-values to the use of money as currency. I really like this analogy too!

(Norah, Taylor, Jason). "Why is eliminating the use of p-values as a truth arbiter so hard? ‘The basic explanation is neither philosophical nor scientific, but sociologic; everyone uses them,’ says Goodman (2019). ‘It’s the same reason we can use money. When everyone believes in something’s value, we can use it for real things; money for food, and p-values for knowledge claims, publication, funding, and promotion. It doesn’t matter if the p-value doesn’t mean what people think it means; it becomes valuable because of what it buys."

The second is a quote that was chosen mainly because it has an interesting take on the word significance:

(Tanner, Brody, Kobe) "As Gelman and Stern (2006) famously observed, the difference between ‘significant’ and ‘not significant’ is not itself statistically significant."
