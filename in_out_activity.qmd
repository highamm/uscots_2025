## Motivation

The theme of this breakout session is "Making a Mathematical Statistics Course More Modern." One of the considerations in making Math Stat more modern is which topics should be included and excluded from the course.

## Task

Consider the following list of topics that often appear in a Mathematical Statistics textbook. This list is loosely based on the table of contents from *Mathematical Statistics with Applications* by Wackerly, Mendenhall, and Scheaffer.

Identify 15 topics that you feel should be in a Math Stat course. For the purposes of this exercise, we are assuming that transformations (method of mgfs, cdfs, and inverse functions) have already been covered in the preceding Probability course).

*Sampling Distributions*

-   Sampling distributions related to the Normal Distribution (e.g., distribution of xbar)

-   Normal distribution theory (relation to Chisq(1), t, etc.) 

-   Central Limit Theorem

-   Simulating Sampling Distributions

*Estimation Topics*

-   Sufficient Statistics

-   Maximum Likelihood Estimation

-   Method of Moments Estimation

-   Bias/Variance/MSE of Estimators

-   Consistency

-   UMVUE

-   Cramer-Rao Lower Bound

-   Asymptotic distribution of MLEs

-   Confidence Intervals using Pivots

-   Confidence Intervals using Bootstrapping

-   "Conceptual" Confidence Intervals (e.g., what does 95% confidence really mean?)

-   Intro Stat Confidence Intervals

-   Distinguishing between large sample and small sample intervals


*Hypothesis Testing Topics*

-   Neyman-Pearson Hypothesis Testing

-   Asymptotic LRT

-   Hypothesis Testing Rejection Regions

-   Hypothesis tests about variance(s)

-   Permutation tests

-   Intro Stat hypothesis tests

-   Distinguishing between large sample and small sample tests

-   Theoretical power and Type I/II Errors

-   Empirical power

*Miscellaneous Topics*

-   Finite Sampling Theory (e.g., finite-population correction factor)

-   Order statistics

-   Sample Size Calculations

-   Limit Theorems (besides the CLT)

*Advanced Topics*

-   Theory of ANOVA

-   Theory of Regression (e.g., proof that standard regression estimators are the best linear unbiased estimators)

-   Bayes

-   Analysis of Categorical Data
