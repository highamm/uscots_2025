## Brief Lit Review

Some of the references we used:

Portfolios of Learning Evidence and Interview Assessments in a MathematicalStatistics Course Michael J. von Maltitz (2025). <https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/epdf/10.1080/26939169.2025.2477151?needAccess=true>


1. Curley and Downey (2024): <https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/26939169.2023.2249956>

Article describing alternative assessment strategies in a math-stat course.

2. Horton and Hardin (2015): <https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00031305.2015.1094283>

See Table 2 on page 262 for some sources that discuss the theoretical stat. curriculum.

3. Horton (2013): https://arxiv.org/pdf/1309.7445

Interesting article on an alternative structure for the course based on the Moore method. Also references a JSM session from 2003 titled "Is the Math Stat Course obsolete?" <https://www.stat.rice.edu/~dobelman/textfiles/MathStatObsolete.Teaching.pdf>

4. Deborah Nolan has a couple from the early 2000s: <https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/users/nolan/Papers/tas.pdf> and <https://iase-web.org/documents/papers/icots6/3e1_dnol.pdf> are both focused on teaching math-stat through "lab" case studies.

5. Another by Horton et al. on incorporating R into math-stat. But it's from 2004, and, given how much coding has changed, is probably less relevant than the others. <http://200.17.213.49/lib/exe/fetch.php/wiki:internas:biblioteca:artigor.pdf>
