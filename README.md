# Making a Mathematical Statistics Course More Modern Breakout Session

This is the repository for the breakout session "Making a Mathematical Statistics Course More Modern," which was co-led by Jessica Chapman (Professor, St. Lawrence University) and Matt Higham (Associate Professor, St. Lawrence University) at the 2025 USCOTS conference in Ames, Iowa.

The materials on this github repository, in order of perceived usefulness are:

* `slides.html`, the slides used during the breakout session.
* `in_out_results.pdf`, the results of an activity during the breakout session, where people voted on what should go "in" and what should go "out" of a modern undergraduate mathematical statistics course. `in_out_activity.qmd` and `in_out_activity.pdf` give the handout that was used for that activity.
* `old_stuff` is a folder of materials (some of which were used, some of which were not used) to help form the slides for the breakout session. Most of the items in this folder are just loose ideas and are not formally written up.

If you have any questions about our breakout session, feel free to email either of us at jchapman@stlawu.edu and/or mhigham@stlawu.edu.
