I also had forgotten that, at the end of the survey, students were asked “The slider questions asked you to consider how \"useful\" you thought various topics were in the course. While you adjusting these sliders, how were you defining \"useful?\" Try to answer this in about 2-5 sentences. “

These answers __did__ have very clear themes. Many talked about the “future.” Many talked about having a practical use outside of a classroom settings. Some talked about a topic being useful if it enhanced conceptually understanding (e.g., number 19).



1. How much I think I will use it in the future / how much I think it's applicable and transferable to everyday life.

2. Useful had two meanings to me:

Could I really see myself needing this in my future career?

Is this something that interests me enough to want to do it more?

3. Useful to me meant how these topics could be applied in a professional setting. If I didn’t remember some concepts, I viewed them as less useful.

4. I defined useful as something that can be applied to scenarios outside of the classroom.

5. I based this on how applicable these things would be to my professional life or general knowledge after college. Things like confidence intervals I could imagine encountering, whereas the pivot method will most likely never come up.

6. I was defining it mostly on real-world use, especially based on the article in Mini Project 5. I also considered skills like being able to simulate things using R.

7. Useful was just: am I going to want to know this in the future? Of course, I don't know that for sure, but it's my own gauge of how relevant the topic is to the rest of the material and potential future applications.

8. I defined useful as how much this would be helpful knowledge to have—information that might be applied in another field or used for statistical understanding.

9. I was defining "useful" as having practical uses outside a classroom setting—concepts I had seen used or referenced in other courses or real-world examples.

10. Things with likely frequent applications in professional or academic settings were more "useful." I also considered how much something deepened my conceptual understanding.

11. I defined useful as something I think I will continue to use or see again in the future—skills or ideas that expand into future learning goals.

12. I tried to imagine the type of work I’d do in a future job. For example, if I were making data-informed decisions, what methods and statistics would I use? What would I need to present my work?

13. Usefulness was a measure of applicability to the practice of statistics or concepts I predict will reappear—whether in grad school, work, or personal projects. I suspect my senior status influenced this perspective.

14. I defined useful as methods that are do-able (not overly abstract) and applicable in real-life situations—tests or tools I could imagine myself or others using.

15. I thought about usefulness in terms of post-graduation work and general application. My views were informed by conversations with professionals in the data industry.

16. Useful also meant understanding the context of a problem. Sometimes I did a derivation mechanically and forgot the context—so usefulness includes applying knowledge to real-life examples.

17. I considered whether I could think of a real-world application or future use in further education or a career. Some topics (e.g., hypothesis testing, frequentist vs Bayesian) stood out as likely to remain relevant.

18. I defined "useful" as: 

* Likelihood I would use this topic in future years beyond academics

* Breadth of real-world application
This view incorporated both personal relevance and broader impact.

19. I defined useful as broader concepts I’d actually remember. For example, understanding the Bayesian framework felt more useful than performing specific derivations.

20. I'm using useful to mean things that apply to a range of topics and that deepen understanding. For instance, learning to explain wrong interpretations is very useful because it helps across multiple statistical concepts.

21. I defined usefulness by how likely I thought the ideas would apply in a job. I was thinking of the average math student who studies for personal growth but not grad school.

22. I was defining usefulness as a topic I could most likely use in the future—topics that feel more applicable and less theoretical.
