read two paragraphs from the paper

give a "bad" conclusion from STAT 113? reject H_0. There is statistically significant evidence that ____ is different than _____ (p-value = ______). (maybe have the example have a large sample size but a small effect size).

provide a lot of additional context.

ask to rewrite using principles from the paper.

explain how your rewrite incorporates the principles from the paper.



Activity Title:
P-Value Headlines: Rewriting the Story

Objective:
To help participants recognize how overreliance on p-values distorts scientific communication and to practice framing results in more informative, transparent ways.

Duration:
15 minutes

Group Size:
3–4 statisticians per group

Materials Needed:
3–4 short “results” blurbs (real or fictional) that report a p-value with a dramatic or oversimplified conclusion
(e.g., “Drug X significantly reduces blood pressure (p = 0.04)!”)

A summary card or slide of key recommendations from the article (e.g., “avoid binary thinking,” “embrace uncertainty,” “use effect sizes, intervals, and context”)

Instructions:
Distribute 1–2 p-value blurbs to each group.

Task (10 minutes):
Each group rewrites the “headline” or key finding without using p-value thresholds (e.g., “significant” or “not significant”), instead emphasizing effect size, uncertainty, or context.
Encourage phrases like:

“We observed a difference of X units, with a 95% confidence interval of...”

“There is evidence suggesting..., though uncertainty remains.”

“The data are consistent with both a small benefit and no effect.”

Share (5 minutes):
Each group quickly presents one original blurb and their rewrite.
If time permits, briefly discuss how the rewritten version changes the interpretation.
