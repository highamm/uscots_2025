## Your Turn

::: task
Form groups of 3 to 5 people with those around you. Introduce yourselves and INSERT SOME INTRO QUESTION. Here are some possible intro questions (pick one or two):

1. What is your favorite course to teach? Do you have a favorite topic in that course? If so, what is it?
2. If you could ban one misused(?) statistical term forever, what would it be?
3. What statistical concept do you secretly love more than you admit?
:::

```{r}
#| echo: false

countdown(minutes = 4)
```

## Motivation

::: goals
1. What more can we do to make math stat more "useful?"
2. ADD OTHER GOALS HERE AFTER MORE IS FLESHED OUT
:::

## What Do We Mean by "Math-Stat"?

```{r}
#| echo: false

<!-- mention typical audience: undergraduate statistics majors who have already taken a lot of calculus and a semester of probability -->

## Motivation: Student Feedback

::: {.callout-important appearance="simple"}

## Feedback A

"I really only think this class is applicable to someone going to grad school or heavily love mathematics. The class is great in that it is difficult and extends your math but very low applicability to life/career."
:::

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}

## Feedback B

"There are so many components of this course that I will be able to apply to my future career and life experiences, a lot of which I think everyone regardless of field of study should at least know a little about."

<!-- other options: "This course has helped my learning because it increased my understanding of important statistical concepts that I will be able to apply in the near future! Also, through this course I have gained critical thinking skills and improved my work on conceptual problems." -->

<!-- other options: "I really enjoyed the real world examples we used and that not every project was analytical; there was a lot of conceptual material as well which made the course well rounded." -->
:::

## Activity

::: task
What does it mean for a math-stat course to be "useful?" In your groups, try to come up with a specific definition for "useful" in this context.

## What Our Students Said (Top 3 Response Types)

* __Applicable to Future__: "I defined useful as something I think I will continue to use or see again in the future—skills or ideas that expand into future learning goals."
* __Applicable to the "Real World"__: "I based this on how applicable these things would be to my professional life or general knowledge after college...."
<!-- Things like confidence intervals I could imagine encountering, whereas the pivot method will most likely never come up." -->
* __Deepened Understanding__: "I (also) considered how much something deepened my conceptual understanding."

## Is Math Stat "Useful?" 

* Could math stat be more "useful?"
* JSM 2003 Session "Is the Math Stat Course obsolete?"
    
    
    <!-- * <https://www.stat.rice.edu/~dobelman/textfiles/MathStatObsolete.Teaching.pdf> -->
    
quotes I like: The math stat course has not changed in 40 years, whereas statistics has changed enormously, so how could the course not be obsolete? - Moore

"Leave out point estimation (or allow 5 min tops), hypothesis testing, power, type I error, type II error, and sample size calculation. Put these topics into the "learn to be a consultant" course. Leave out one sample z, two sample t, one sample , chi-square. Leave it out! There is a lot in the traditional course that is worth while but the psyche of the traditional course is not working anymore. The ways to turn it around are not that different than the statistical literacy course..... leave out UMVUE and unbiasedness." - Reid

"The worse thing is that it tends to bore the teachers, and if teachers are bored, students don’t get the liveliness of the subject." - Efron

idea that comes up a bit: modeling.

"We should de-emphasize t-test, jackknife, named nonparametric methods, asymptotics (I’ve never seen an infinite sample), Cramer-Rao lower bound. It should not be too much like a catalog. I would add modeling, computing (likelihood graphics), problem solving, decision calculations (how to think about the best thing to do), risk, odds, expectation, sample and experimental design (at least touch on that), foundational issues such as understanding p-values (direction of conditioning), worrying about whether they are any good." - Morris

DM: I heard no support for continuing to teach optimal testing (Neyman-Pearson) in first course?
All: right

question about proofs: "I don’t know. My first reaction is to say do not teach formal derivation. Var(Xbar) is reasonably accessible, but if BE did not understand the t distribution when he first saw it, then your students won't. I can’t see emphasizing so much the derivations of these distributions, especially those using multivariate calculus. Reality has surpassed us – you will not be able to squeeze all of this into this course."

## Activity: Short Story

* _Fostering Conceptual Understanding in Mathematical Statistics_ by Green and Blankenship (2015).
    * published in _The American Statistician_.

## Activity: Short Story

A "meaningful story" is one continuous piece of writing / creative work that uses key words from a list and in which the sentences "make sense and hang together." That is, the ideas in the story must illustrate that you understand key concepts from math-stat in a way that allows you to write "meaningfully" about them. It is your job to use the terms in a way that demonstrates that you understand the statistical concepts involved and why we care about these terms in the big picture of statistical theory.

## Activity: Short Story

<!-- hat topics can just be taken from what our students actually wrote about.  -->
<!-- e.g., living on a farm, gender inequality in sports, 80s music, applying to jobs, landing on an alien planet, etc. -->

::: task
With your small group, orally contruct a __meaningful paragraph__ about a topic that you will draw from a hat using __3__ of the following __5__ terms:

* Estimator
* Estimate (as a noun)
* Parameter
* Bias
* Variance

## What Our Students Wrote About

* 80's music.
* applying to jobs (this is a spring semester course of mostly seniors!).
* gender inequality in women's and men's hockey.
* living on a farm.
* all kinds of sports!

## What a Student Said

"The second mini-project was the most impactful assessment for me....This project was very different from much of the Math/Stat curriculum and a unique opportunity to show understanding of different terms. Being forced to use these terms in the context of a sentence helps to develop a better understanding of what they mean. It is difficult to explain terms like estimator, variance, or binomial distribution in a statistical context of a story without a good understanding of their meanings...."

<!-- This project helped to build a base of vocabulary and to show that being able to explain concepts or terms is a good way to demonstrate or practice understanding of those concepts. -->

## Motivation: Student Feedback

"I really hope that I remember Bayes. I feel like this would be helpful for me to remember because I want to
study epidemiology and public health. As we learn more about disease and track new diseases it will probably
be useful to update our ideas with what we have learned."

"In my opinion, the process of coming up with a prior is a creative one. There is no single correct answer for
a prior distribution, it is only based on previous knowledge around a subject. Different people may
come up with different priors, and in turn create a posterior distribution based on data examined after
the prior is created. It takes creativity to be a Bayesian"

"I would like to know more about how experts in a field develop informative priors for
Bayesian Modeling."

"Bayesian statistics is a whole different world where we
think about the parameters as random quantities and not having true values. I really liked
the process of starting with a prior distribution and then using the data to update our
beliefs with a posterior distribution."

"I initially struggled understanding Bayesian statistics. I could not wrap my head around that
concept because I like to find an answer from a given formula. I do not like when
answers can be subjective and with Bayesian statistics, the choice of the prior distribution
is highly subjective. I was getting frustrated with myself because I was struggling to
understand the material and how to do the homework problems. However, I had this
realization one afternoon that in order to understand this material, I had to let go of the
idea that there was only one correct way to set up a Bayesian problem."

"I struggled to understand the Bayesian unit at first. I didn’t really understand why we were
doing this odd method where we made up stuff to start. I finally understood how the prior
distribution affected the posterior, with the parameters acting like observations. We can think that
our prior beliefs are worth some actual data, which will contribute to the data we have to create a
potentially more accurate model."

## Activity: Bayes

"One topic I found interesting was Bayesian Statistics. This topic incorporates things I
have enjoyed, like kernel matching and finding likelihood functions. It was interesting
going over different examples in class. I particularly enjoyed the cat-lover example. We
started with a prior belief about the proportion of people who prefer cats to dogs. Then,
through a show-of-hands, we collected data. This example took the words off the slides
for me, demonstrating a practical application of the method. My prior belief was that the
majority of people prefer dogs. However, if I remember correctly, none of us raised our
hands in support of cats. Despite my prior belief, this was still super surprising."

## Activity: p-value Paper

Wasserstein, R. L., Schirm, A. L., & Lazar, N. A. (2019). Moving to a world beyond "p< 0.05". _The American Statistician_, _73_(sup1), 1-19.

<!-- To move forward to a world beyond "p < 0.05," we must recognize afresh that statistical inference is not - and never has been - equivalent to scientific inference (Hubbard, Haig, and Parsa 2019; Ziliak 2019). However, looking to statistical significance for a marker of scientific observations' credibility has created a guise of equivalency.  -->

"Moving beyond 'statistical significance' opens researchers to the real significance of statistics, which is 'the science of learning from data, and of measuring, controlling, and communicating uncertainty' (Davidian and Louis 2012)."

## What Our Students Said

<!-- The last mini project taught me to think more critically about statistics.  -->

"I always considered p-values to be the best way to measure significance and did not question what a p-value really meant. The project taught me what statistical thinking is and to take into account more than just whether a p-value passes some threshold. In intro statistics, we are taught to follow specific steps and formulas without much background knowledge or reasoning. I am someone who does not often question information, especially in classes....."

<!-- I take the information given to me and regard it as the truth, and the best way to solve a problem. Further than just p-values, I realized that even though something is taught a certain way, there may be more information or different interpretations. Especially in quantitative classes, it is easy to see a formula and not question it, but it is important to understand where things come from, and why we use the methods we are taught. -->

## What Our Students Said

<!-- I think that I learned the most from mini project 5, since it was one of the more interesting mathematical papers I have read. The discussion of redefining the way we look at statistical analysis had me hungry for more. It  -->

"(The p-value paper) was probably the most thought-provoking assignment for me because it forced me to think critically about how we conduct research. Coming from an Economics background, there is a lot of conversation around the reliability or quality of research. I felt that this assessment was the most impactful for me long-term because it forced me to think critically about something that I had previously just taken for granted...."

 <!-- It almost felt like I was back in a philosophy class that I took when I thought I wanted to be a philosophy major. I enjoy thinking about ways to challenge the status quo, so although this assessment was more of a one-off that did not have a great technical focus, I believe that it stimulated my thought process the most out of all assessments. I learned to consider many factors when conducting research, which had a profound impact on my honors project and the conclusions I was able to draw from my analysis. I believe that the broad reach of this assignment, or its cross-functionality across subjects, is what made me enjoy it so much. For me, enjoyment and learning are highly correlated, so when I am enjoying a topic thoroughly, I can deepen my learning. -->

## What Our Students Said
"I hope to remember that hypothesis tests are fragile instruments. I hope to remember that
they do not prove anything and provide insight into how much evidence there is for or against the
null hypothesis in a probabilistic sense."
